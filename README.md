# Yardscaper

**Yardscaper** is a 2D sprinkler system design tool with built-in fluid simulation. Plan out full irrigation layouts using pipes, connectors, and sprinkler heads, then simulate water flow to calculate pressures, flow rates, and head losses throughout your system. It's built with the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/), and also includes tools for general yard planning‚Äîsuch as area measurement, shape drawing, and photo-based scaling.
